# Quick Start

This guide walks you through using Sunsettings as a user in under 2 minutes.

## 1) Open the app
- In a regular browser: open the website.
- In the Base app (Farcaster Mini App): open from the channel or your bookmarks.

## 2) Onboarding tour
- The tour explains what Sunsettings does, how we predict sunset beauty, how to post, and where your account is.

## 3) Pick a location
- Use the location combobox to search a place.
- Or tap Detect to use your current position.
  - Inside Base Mini App, we prefer the Mini App context for location.
  - If not available, we fall back to browser geolocation or IP (coarse).

## 4) Calculate prediction
- We analyze weather signals (temperature, clouds, air quality, humidity, wind, etc.) and predict the beauty of the sunset (the “science” view).
- You can later rate the sunset yourself — personal perception can differ.

## 5) Capture and post a photo
- Be physically at the same location you analyzed.
- Use “Take photo” to open the camera and upload.
- We attach rounded coordinates/time and display a neighborhood/city label.

## 6) View your profile
- See your posts and progress/streaks.

## Notes on privacy and data
- We don’t store raw precise GPS in the backend. We store blurred location (center + radius) and a human-readable label.
