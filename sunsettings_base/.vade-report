# React Flight / Next.js RCE Advisory Fix

## Summary
Upgraded the sunsettings-base project to address the React Flight / Next.js RCE advisory by patching vulnerable Next.js versions.

## Vulnerability Assessment
✅ **AFFECTED**: Project uses Next.js 15.5.x
❌ **NOT AFFECTED BY REACT FLIGHT**: No vulnerable React Flight packages found (react-server-dom-webpack, react-server-dom-parcel, react-server-dom-turbopack)
❌ **REACT NOT VULNERABLE**: `react` and `react-dom` are not directly vulnerable (only React Flight packages are affected)

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. **package.json**
   - Upgraded `next` from `15.5.4` to `15.5.7` (patched version for 15.5.x)
   - Upgraded `eslint-config-next` from `15.5.4` to `15.5.7` (must match Next.js version)

2. **pnpm-lock.yaml**
   - Updated all Next.js 15.5.7 dependencies
   - Locked to patched versions across the dependency tree

### Why These Changes
- **Next.js 15.5.x** is affected by the RCE vulnerability; upgrade to `15.5.7` per official guidelines
- **eslint-config-next** must match the installed Next.js version
- **React/React-DOM** were NOT manually upgraded per instructions: "For Next.js projects, do not manually upgrade react or react-dom. Next.js will supply the correct patched React dependency versions automatically."

## Project Assessment Details
- Root project: Next.js application using Next.js 15.5.4 (vulnerable)
- Workspace packages: sunsettings-nft (Hardhat/Solidity - not affected)
- Package manager: pnpm
- React version: 19.1.0 (compatible with Next.js 15.5.7)
- No React Flight packages in use

## Build Verification
✅ Build completes successfully: `next build --turbopack` runs without errors
✅ Linter runs without new issues (pre-existing issues unrelated to security fix)
✅ All routes compile correctly (18 static pages generated)

## Implementation Approach
1. Identified vulnerable Next.js 15.5.4 in package.json
2. Upgraded to patched version 15.5.7 per advisory guidelines
3. Updated matching eslint-config-next version
4. Regenerated lockfile with `pnpm install`
5. Verified build succeeds with new versions
6. Confirmed no regressions in application functionality
